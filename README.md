
# BLAZE PREDICT: PREDICTIVE MODELlING OF FIRE SIZES USING CLIMATE INDICATORS

This project aims to predict the occurrence and scale of wildfires using a combination of historical wildfire data and various climate indicators. The data spans from 2008-2018 and provides insights into the patterns of wildfires in the US. By integrating multiple data sources and employing advanced machine learning models, we offer a tool that can be instrumental in wildfire preparedness and response strategies.

## Project Structure
- **DataProcessing.ipynb:** This notebook handles the extraction and preprocessing of the forest fire data. The data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's FPA_FOD_20210617.sqlite database.
- **FireAnalysis.ipynb:** Contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the forest fire data. Various visualizations and statistics are generated to understand the data better.
- **Predictive Modelling and Evaluation.ipynb:** This notebook contains the predictive models used to forecast the occurrence and size of wildfires. It focuses on the FIRE_SIZE_CLASS variable as the target.
- **Datasets:** A folder to store the datasets used in this project, including the source data and processed data.
- **Plots:** Stores plots and figures generated during the analysis and model evaluation phases.
- **Final Project Poster.pdf:** An academic poster that provides an overview of the project, its objectives, methods, and results.


## Dataset Overview & Preprocessing

The FPA_FOD_20210617.sqlite database is preprocessed and combined with the meteorological data to form the `final_dataset2008-18.csv`. Extensive data cleaning, NA handling, and feature engineering were performed and `model_dataset2008-18.csv` is formed to ensure the quality and reliability of the predictive models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset was explored to gain insights into fire occurrences, sizes, causes, and their relationship with climatic variables. Descriptive statistics were computed, and visualizations like bar plots, pie charts, and heat maps were used to better understand the data.

## Methodology

Various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Deep Neural Networks, and Random Forest were employed. Through iterative experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, we identified models that best predict wildfire occurrences and sizes based on the provided predictors.

## Visual Insights

- **Fire Size by State**: Comparing fire sizes across states.

- **Target Class Distribution**: Representing target variable `FIRE_SIZE_CLASS` distribution in final dataset.
![Class Distribution](Project/Plots/Class_Distribution.png)

Fire Size Class | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | N 
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- 
Size | 0 to .25 acres | .26 to 9.9 acres | 10.0 to 99.9 acres | 100 to 299 acres| 300 to 999 acres | 1000 to 4999 acres | 5000+ acres | No Fire
 

## Challenges & Limitations

Data size, missing values, computational constraints, and data balance were the primary challenges faced. The large dataset size and computational limitations made it essential to balance model performance with efficiency.

## Conclusion & Future Work

This project demonstrates the potential of predictive modeling in addressing wildfires. While the models provided valuable insights, future work could focus on integrating more data sources like satellite imagery and real-time monitoring systems to further enhance predictive capabilities.
